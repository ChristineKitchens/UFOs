# UFOs
Use Javascript and HTML to make a dynamic webpage containing UFO sighting information.

## Overview
The following project is part of a mock assignment using Javascript and HTML to make a dynamic webpage containing UFO sighting information. The client requested a webpage to feature their article on UFO sitings and a dynamic table of sitings that users can view and filter according to their criteria. Filter criteria include the following:

- Date (1/1/2010-1/13/2010)
- City
- State
- Country
- Shape

## Summary
There are some drawbacks to the new design. For example, to reset the table after applying the filters, the user either needs to manually delete the filter values or refresh the browser. Also, it might not be apparent to the user the different values that can be chosen for a given filter. For example, while someone might be able to guess that one entry for the "shape" field could be a circle, it's challenging to guess what other options are available without sifting through the whole data set.

Therefore, for futher development, it's recommended that the filter input boxes be ammended to include a dropdown menu of potential values. It's also recommended to install a reset button that clears out all the filters on a click event.
